# PokeApp

## Pokemon Search Engine and type calculator developed in React + TypeScript

PokeApp is a Pokemon Search Engine and type calculator developed in React + TypeScript. It fetches data from an external API (PokeAPI) using Axios and filters the most accurate results based on the user input. It also takes advantage of React Hooks, Function Components, Use Effect, etc. The prototyping was made using Adobe XD and the views were made using Bootstrap and Styled Components.

This Web Application was possible using PokeAPI: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2
